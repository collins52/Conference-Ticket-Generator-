## My process
I built this entire project on mobile so it's design is optimized for mobile view no offense ðŸ¥²ðŸ« . Guess it's one of the cons of coding on mobile. ðŸ˜… But hey, passion beats hardware anyways. For development i used a code editor named spck editor a mobile editor available on playstore.

How i built it: 
* i started by designing the header for the form page then styling it made some adjustments on the way though. 
* Then i design the tickets html and styled which i also made adjustments on the way
* JavaScript came last (saved the best for last ðŸ˜…)

Took me a month to finish the project. Obstacles were inconsistency ðŸ¥², lacked motivation ðŸ˜ž and also not having a laptop. ðŸ¥² But I pushed through!
Just wanted to share my experience to encourage anyone out there if I could do it, so can you! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚.

### Built with

### What I learned

I learnt how to preview uploaded image from input file with js

```js
const reader = new FileReader;
      reader.readAsDataURL(file) reader.onLoad is triggered
      reader.onload = function(e) {
      img.src = e.target.result;
```
i also learnt how to stack various background image and arrange them over each other in css(background.css)
```css
background: 
     url('./assets/images/pattern-circle.svg')/* circle*/, 
     url('./assets/images/pattern-squiggly-line-top.svg')/*squiggly line top*/, 
     url('./assets/images/pattern-circle.svg')/*circle*/, 
    url('./assets/images/pattern-squiggly-line-bottom.svg')/*squiggly line*/, 
     url('./assets/images/pattern-lines.svg'),
     url('./assets/images/background-mobile.png');
 background-repeat: no-repeat;
 background-size: 120px 100vh, 120px 100vh, 120px 100vh, 300px 100vh, 280vw 100vh, 150vw 300vh;
 background-position: -20px -325px, 240px -300px, 285px 260px, 1px 570px, 0 0;
 background-attachment: scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll;
 padding: 15px;
```

### Continued development

I want to add a regex to check for valid emails address.
